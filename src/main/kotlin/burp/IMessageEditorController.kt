 * it to another Burp tool). Extensions that provide custom editor tabs via an
 * `IMessageEditorTabFactory` will receive a reference to an
 * `IMessageEditorController` object for each tab instance they
 * generate, which the tab can invoke if it requires further information about
 * the current message.
